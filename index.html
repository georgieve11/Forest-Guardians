                <h2>How trees protect and shape our World</h2>
                <p>
                    In the heart of every thriving forest, it’s not mythical creatures that stand guard it’s the trees. Towering and ancient, they are the true guardians. Far from passive, trees are active stewards of their ecosystems, quietly shaping the world around them.
                    Each trunk is a pillar of patience; each branch, an outstretched arm of protection. Trees anchor soil, purify air, shelter wildlife, absorb storms, and resist erosion. From root to crown, they serve as both providers and protectors.
                    Even in stillness, trees are alive with intention. They sense changes in light and moisture, and communicate underground through vast fungal networks sharing resources, warning of danger, and nurturing the vulnerable. This is ancient intelligence, woven into the forest itself.
                    Trees protect not by moving, but by being deeply present. They stabilize climates, capture carbon, and offer peace to those who pause beneath them. They’ve weathered fires and droughts, rebuilding slowly, year by year.
                    In every rustling leaf and whispering canopy is quiet wisdom a reminder that true guardianship doesn’t roar. Sometimes, it simply stands tall.</p>

                <h2>Protectors of Biodiversity</h2>
                <p> 
                    From the canopy to the forest floor, trees are essential to life in an ecosystem. Their branches offer shade, shelter, and nesting spots, while their leaves clean the air and produce oxygen. Birds, insects, mammals, mosses, fungi, and countless other organisms rely on trees for food and habitat. Even their roots play a role, stabilizing the soil and helping distribute water and nutrients to surrounding life.
                    Without trees, these complex systems begin to fall apart habitats vanish, biodiversity declines, and the balance of nature is disrupted. But when trees are protected and allowed to thrive, so does life around them. Forests regenerate, species flourish, and the environment becomes healthier for all. Trees are the backbone of vibrant, living ecosystems.

         <h2>Types of trees</h2>
        <p>There are various types of trees. Some of them are evergreen and some are deciduous. Deciduous trees shed their leaves annually, typically in the fall, while evergreen trees retain their leaves throughout the year. Deciduous trees have flat, broad leaves, whereas evergreen trees often have needle-like or scale-like leaves. Evergreen trees are often conifers, reproducing by cones, and include trees like pines and spruces. </p>
